# Link it to me

Want to send messages like a secret agent? Like stuff that blows up? Then this is the website for you!

Login with your existing Google account to create custom messages that are set to self-destruct on a certain
date, or after being viewed a certain number of times. You customize when, and how many times, that will be.

Once you've made a message, you will be given a special link to send to whomever you want to see it; but do be
careful! You can cause your own messages to explode by clicking on them!

Don't worry about losing track of secret messages though, all the messages you've made are listed on your admin
page and can be read without clicking on them &mdash; at least until their timer makes them explode!
